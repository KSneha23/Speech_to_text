# Speech Recognition and Text-to-Speech Python Script
A simple Python script that performs real-time speech recognition using a microphone and converts recognized speech to text. It also features text-to-speech conversion to speak back the recognized text.
This Python script uses the `speech_recognition` library to capture audio from your microphone, recognize spoken words, and convert them to text. It then uses the `pyttsx3` library to speak back the recognized text.
